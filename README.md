# Cheatsheets
<h2>What, why?<h2>
  
Cheatsheets are what I use to function apparently and I feel like most of the cheatsheets are oversatured with just useless minute information of other resources and information that might not be actually useful in a real-life scenario, So I decided to try to make and a cheatsheets that ARE useful that WILL atleast help one person ill attempt to have them not be blaoted with as much applicable useful information as possible and keep them useful for real activities like CTF's or possibly in the near future real life scenarios

I hope you find these useful and if you have any feedback please feel free to tell me!
