Aggressive Defense:
```
w # to see whos in with you
tty # To find out what PTS you are 
ps aux | grep pts # Then, look at the pts number from the result.
kill -9 $PID

ps aux --forest                     # to see in a tree POV
ps aux --forest | grep pts          # to see only where enemies came from
```

To break a shell:
```
cat /dev/urandom > /dev/pts/$
```

Cronjob upload:
```
* *     * * *   root    echo N0rthWinds > /root/king.txt
```

FindingÂ  possible flags:
```
find / -type f -exec grep -l "thm{" {} \; 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -exec grep -l "THM{" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

```
chmod u-s file_name #SUID
chmod g-s file_name #SGID
```

chmod 000 /path/to/program && chown -u root && mv file /usr/sbin
```

Vulnerable LFI patch:
```
str_replace("../","",$_GET['VARIABLE'])
